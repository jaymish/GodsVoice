5,3,What is Krsna consciousness?,"Krsna means God. We are all intimately connected with Him because He is our original father. But we have forgotten this connection. When we become interested in knowing, ""What is my connection with God? What is the aim of life?"" then we are called Krsna conscious."
6,4,How does Krsna consciousness develop in the practitioner?,"Krsna consciousness is already there in the core of everyone's heart. But because of our materially conditioned life, we have forgotten it. The process of chanting the Hare Krsna mahdad-mantra-Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare-revives the Krsna consciousness we already have. For example, a few months ago these American and European boys and girls did not know about Krsna, but just yesterday we saw how they were chanting Hare Krsna and dancing in ecstasy throughout the whole Ratha-yatra procession [an annual festival sponsored by the Krsna consciousness movement in cities around the world]. Do you think that was artificial? No. Artificially, nobody can chant and dance for hours together. They have actually awakened their Krsna consciousness by following a bona fide process. This is explained in the Caitanya-caritamrta."
7,5,What is the difference between Krsna consciousness and Qhrist consciousness?,"Christ consciousness is also Krsna consciousness, but because at present people do not follow the rules and regulations of Chnstianity—the commandments of Jesus Christ—they do not come to the standard of God consciousness."
8,6,What is unique about Krsna consciousness among all sehigions?,"Primarily, religion means to know God and to love Ham. That is religion. Nowadays, because of a lack of training, nobody kmows God, what to speak of loving Him. People are satisfied simply going to church and praying, O God, give us our daily bread. In the Simad-Bhagavatam this is called a cheating religion, because the aim is to know and love God but to gain some personal profit. In other words, if I profess to follow some religion, but I do not know who God is or how to love Him, I am practicing a cheating religion. As far as the Chnstian religion is concerned, ample opportunity is given to understand God, but no one is taking it. For example, the Bible contains the commandment Thou shall not kill, but Christians have built the world's best slaughterhouses. How can they become God conscious if they disobey the commandments of Lord Jesus Christ? And this is going on not past in the Christian religion, but in every religion. The title ""Hindu"", ""Muslim,"" or ""Christian"" is simply a rubber stamp. None of them knows who God is and how to love Him. Ms. Nixon: How can one tell a bona fide spiritual master from a fake? Sila Prabhupada: Whoever teaches how to know God and how to love Him he is a spiritual master. Sometimes bogus rascals mislead people. ""I am God,"" they claim, and people who do not know what God is believe them. You must be a serious student to understand who God is and how to love Him. Otherwise, you will simply waste your time. So the difference between others and us is that we are the only movement that can actually teach one how to know God and how to love Him. We are presenting the science of how one can know Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by practicing the teachings of the Bhagavad-gita and the Srimad-Bhdgavatam. They teach us that our only business is to love God. Our business is not to ask God for our necessities. God gives necessities to everyone even to one who has no religion. For example, cats and dogs have no religion, yet Krsna supplies them with the necessities of life. So why should we bother Krsna for our daily bread? He is already supplying it. Real religion means to learn how to love Him. The Srimad-Bhdgavatam [1.2.6] says,  sa vai pumsam paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhoksaje  ahaituky apratihata yayatma suprasidati  First-class religion teaches one how to love God without any motive. If I serve God for some profit, that is business not love. Real love of God is ahaituky apratihata: it cannot be checked by any material cause. It is unconditional. If one actually wants to love God, there is no impediment. One can love Him whether one is poor or rich, young or old, black or white."
9,3,What does Krishna Consciousness mean? ,"Krishna consciousness is a state of awareness in which an individual acts in complete harmony with the Divine or the ultimate reality of Krishna. It is a form of Bhakti yoga (or devotional service) in which the purpose is to devote one's thoughts, actions and worship to pleasing Krishna, who some consider to be the supreme god.  To act with Krishna consciousness is to free the self from the illusion that it is an individual body. It is a way to experience the bliss of one's true, eternal nature. It is said that anyone can do this and that Krishna consciousness is something everyone has naturally.  Practicing yoga can be a powerful tool for stepping outside the ego and cultivating Krishna consciousness. "
